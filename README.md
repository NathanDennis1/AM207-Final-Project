# AM207-Final-Project
Final Project code and CSV files for AM207

Nathan Dennis and John Breedis


The csv files here contain all the results from our initial simulations from google colab. The first string for each file is the algorithm used, such as CMA-ES, DE, or PSO. Next, the string after is what dimension/regression the data is used on, such as SLR, MLR, or Poly (Polynomial Regression). The next strings contain the actual file, such as times_iterations representing the runtime and number of iterations to converge. The mses_pop files represent the mses, mean and standard deviation, of the simulations. The final string is the population size, 50 or 100.
